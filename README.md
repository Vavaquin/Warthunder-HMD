HMD Warthunder is an application that creates a Helmet Mount Display similar to that of the F16.

HMD Warthunder is an overlay system for Warthunder that puts the most important flight information directly on your screen, just like a Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD). It also features Betty-style voice alerts, so you never miss a critical detail during the game. With a dynamic display, it only shows what really matters, making your flight experience more practical and immersive.

It has adaptive information; for example, if the aircraft cannot provide flight time, this information will not occupy the screen. It supports variable wing geometry and VTOL.
