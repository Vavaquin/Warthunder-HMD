# Warthunder-HMD
Helmet Mount display for warthunder


HMD Warthunder is an application that creates a Helmet Mount Display similar to that of the F16.

It has adaptive information; for example, if the aircraft cannot provide flight time, this information will not occupy the screen. It supports variable wing geometry and VTOL.

To use it, simply download the release version, open it, and press F9 once the application starts.

F9 locks the overlay above the desktop.
F10 removes the central reticle but can only be changed when F9 is deactivated.

To close, just press F9 and close the application from the Windows taskbar.
